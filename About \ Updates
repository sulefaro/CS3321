====UHD Database.zip===

This zip consists of the base framework for this database. As of right now it has three main windows, login screen(Login.h), 
admin screen(adminFormDB.h) and student screen(studentFormDB.h), the last two will show the database in some fashion.

*** Make sure you download CLI on your visual studio, without that this will not run or you won't be able to edit it ***
*** Go to your visual studio installer and through go to individual components, select all the options that have CLI in them***

As of right now, the login button does not work, which will take the inputs of the two text boxes. I'll upload the code separately
which will be Login.cpp on github so you don't have to upload the entire project for updates.

Once you run the program, there are two things that work
1. Password textbox shows all letters as asterisks when input is put in
2. Forgot password button takes you to UHD password reset site.
